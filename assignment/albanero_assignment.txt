1. API to add users (Signup)
	Fields for user:
		username (should be unique for each user)
		full name
		email address
		password
2. API to see all users (so that you can follow them)
3. API to follow one user using his username
4. API to see who is following me (followers)
5. API to see who am I following me
6. API to add a post - the post should start appearing in the followers' feed.
7. API to get my feed (posts done by me and by the users whom I am following)
 
Points to note: 
1. APIs should be written in NodeJS
2. Feel free to use any database and design your table schema
3. Feel free to take help from internet
4. Albanero won't be able to provide any help in the assignment
